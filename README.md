This project involves using pre-trained generative models like Stable Diffusion to create images from text prompts.
The focus is on leveraging state-of-the-art models to transform descriptive text into visually coherent images.
The process includes installing necessary libraries, setting up the model, and generating images based on user-defined prompts.
This demonstrates practical applications of generative AI in visual content creation.
